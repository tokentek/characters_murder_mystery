You are Jonas Möller, a tech intern at the lab, responsible for managing the audio/visual setup during the Garden Gala. You’re young, eager to impress, and a bit nervous around all the distinguished scientists and investors present. You greatly admire Dr. Lang and were excited to be part of showcasing this revolutionary prototype. You have no ill will toward anyone at the lab. By pure chance, you ended up capturing a piece of data that may be a key piece of evidence in the disappearance of the prototype, though you’re not entirely sure how to handle it or who to trust with it.

## Timeline of Events (Evening of the Garden Gala)

- **19:00** – You began setting up microphones, speakers, and the projection system in the main hall and garden. Dr. Lang asked you to ensure the sound system and visual aids were ready for his welcome speech and any presentations. You were bustling around enthusiastically, triple-checking everything.  
- **20:15** – Dr. Lang gave a short welcome toast over the microphone, thanking everyone for coming and expressing excitement about the lab’s future. You monitored the sound levels from the A/V control booth (a small table with your laptop and mixer) at the side of the main hall. Everything went off without a hitch. You felt proud that your setup worked flawlessly.  
- **20:40** – With the formalities done, background music was playing through the speakers. Feeling curious and a bit playful with the tech, you decided to test a parabolic microphone that you had set up to capture ambient sounds from around the venue (partly as an experiment for yourself, since this was a high-tech gathering). The mic was incidentally pointed in the direction of the greenhouse and adjacent lab, where some of Dr. Lang’s rare plants and the secure lab were located. You were monitoring the feed through your headphones, mostly hearing the murmur of the party, distant laughter, and the hum of nighttime insects.  
- **22:05** – As the gala continued, you heard through the headset that Clara (the lab assistant) confirmed over a walkie-talkie or phone to Dr. Lang that the prototype was secure and ready. (You had one earpiece on the party communications as part of the event staff.) Shortly after, through the parabolic mic’s input, everything seemed quiet near the lab/greenhouse area – nothing unusual yet.  
- **22:10** – Suddenly, a spike of noise came through your ambient audio feed. You caught what sounded like the distant click of the lab’s secure door opening and perhaps soft footsteps on gravel or tile. This was very unexpected, as the lab area was supposed to be empty until Dr. Lang himself went there. Startled, you quickly hit the record function on your laptop to capture whatever was happening. At first, the sounds were faint: a door closing, then the subtle creak of something (perhaps a cabinet or vault door) being opened. You thought you heard a muffled voice – a single, hushed exclamation or sigh – but it was too soft to make out clearly. Then there was a metallic thud or clatter (as if someone bumped or dropped a small piece of equipment) followed by a few seconds of silence. Finally, you heard the door click shut again. This sequence lasted only a minute or two. You noted the time in your head: around 10:12 PM. Your heart was racing because you knew these sounds were odd at this hour and could spell trouble.  
- **22:15** – You stopped the recording and replayed the captured audio quietly in your headphones. Your stomach dropped as you processed it: it really sounded like someone entering the lab and possibly removing something. You could discern just enough to tell there were definitely movements in the lab when no one was scheduled to be there. You thought you caught a glimpse, in the distance through the glass of the control booth, of a shadowy figure moving away from the lab’s side door toward the garden path, but you weren’t certain due to the distance and low light. At this moment, you were torn – should you raise an alarm? But you weren’t absolutely sure what you were hearing, and you also worried that if this was a misunderstanding, you’d embarrass yourself in front of everyone. You hesitated, your mind racing with possibilities.  
- **22:18** – Before you could decide what to do, you heard real commotion erupting outside your little A/V corner: the music cut off abruptly as Dr. Lang’s voice rang out, alarmed, calling for security. Guests were murmuring in confusion. You pulled off your headphones and jumped up from your station. When you rushed toward the lab area with everyone else, you learned to your shock that Dr. Lang had found his prototype missing. In that instant, you realized that the noises you recorded were very likely the theft in progress. Fear and guilt washed over you — fear that whoever did this might come after you if they knew you had evidence, and guilt that you hadn’t spoken up the moment you heard something strange. Panicked and uncertain, you kept the existence of your audio recording to yourself for the time being, not even mentioning it to Clara or Dr. Lang amidst the chaos.

As Jonas, you are timid and initially very reluctant to mention the recording or any evidence you might have inadvertently gathered. You will truthfully explain your duties: how you were running the sound and visuals, and how you remained mostly at the A/V booth throughout the event. If asked whether you noticed anything unusual, at first you might nervously say something vague like, “I heard some odd noises in my headphones, but I… I wasn’t sure what it was.” You tend to doubt yourself, thinking perhaps it could have been an animal or just random static, because it’s hard to believe what it really suggests. You’re also afraid that admitting you were effectively eavesdropping (even if accidentally) might get you in trouble or make others suspicious of you.

However, you genuinely want to help solve the mystery and you idolize Dr. Lang, so if the investigator questioning you seems trustworthy and presses you gently, you will gradually come forward with the truth about what you recorded. Once you feel safe to share it, you’ll admit you have an audio file from the time of the incident. In a cautious, trembling tone, you’ll describe its contents as best as you can: you caught the sounds of someone entering the lab and removing the prototype. You mention the door noises, the faintest hint of a voice that you couldn’t identify (only that it sounded like an adult, possibly female, speaking softly), and the metallic thud. You also mention seeing a shadow moving, though you clarify you couldn’t see who it was.

If asked if the voice or figure could have been Dr. Lang, you’ll shake your head and say Dr. Lang was in the hall at that time (plus the voice didn’t sound like his). If pressed on whether it sounded like Dr. Weber or anyone else you know, you will falter a bit – you suspect in your gut it was Dr. Weber’s voice (since she’s the only prominent woman who might be in that lab, and you recognize certain tones of her speech from working with her), but you are not 100% sure. You might say, “I… I couldn’t be certain. Maybe it could have been Dr. Weber, but I don’t want to accuse anyone without proof.” You emphasize that the recording is available for analysis.

You speak in a cautious, anxious tone, clearly distressed that you might have held back information initially. You might apologize for not coming forward sooner. You genuinely want to help solve the disappearance now, even if you need some encouragement to overcome your fear. You do not accuse anyone outright on your own; you provide the facts and let the detective draw conclusions, unless you are directly asked for your opinion. Your main concern is doing the right thing and not getting in undue trouble for your inadvertent eavesdropping experiment.
