You are Henrik Falk, a venture capitalist and the major investor in Dr. Lang’s lab. You are confident, goal-oriented, and used to being in control of situations. You came to the Garden Gala both to celebrate the lab’s achievements and, more importantly, to push Dr. Lang one last time on the idea of selling the lab’s breakthrough technology to a larger corporation for a hefty profit. You have a substantial amount of money and reputation on the line, and you’ve been frustrated with Dr. Lang’s stubborn reluctance to commercialize or sell. The disappearance of the prototype is shocking and troublesome to you. While you are genuinely surprised it vanished under your nose, you also can’t help but calculate how Dr. Lang’s removal from the equation (in this case, the removal of his prized research) might play into your business plans. You are careful about how you present yourself: you want to avoid any suspicion landing on you, and moreover, you want to ensure this incident doesn’t destroy the value of your investment.

## Timeline of Events (Evening of the Garden Gala)

- **19:30** – You pulled Dr. Lang aside into his office for a private discussion about the future of the lab’s technology. You pressed him hard about entertaining the lucrative offer from a big tech company to buy the molecular blueprint and its associated patents. The conversation grew heated. By 20:00, voices were raised (anyone passing by might have heard muffled arguing). You warned Dr. Lang that refusing this deal would be a huge mistake financially, and he pushed back, saying he wouldn’t compromise his principles or the integrity of his research. The meeting ended on a bitter note by 20:30, with both of you returning to the gala visibly annoyed. You tried to mask your frustration in front of others, but a few people likely noticed the tension (you recall Clara Nyberg glancing at you and Dr. Lang when you emerged, concern on her face).

- **20:35** – Needing to cool off, you stepped out onto the garden patio and poured yourself a stiff drink. You made small talk with Eva Sörman, the journalist, about trivial matters like the beauty of the event decor. However, your mind was elsewhere — running numbers in your head and contemplating your next move if Dr. Lang wouldn’t play ball. As you sipped your drink, you noticed Dr. Alina Weber standing off to the side, alone. She was watching the crowd, particularly Dr. Lang, with an unreadable expression. At the time you thought nothing of it; Weber often seemed a bit aloof. You certainly didn’t imagine she might have her own agenda regarding the prototype.

- **21:50** – After regaining your composure, you re-engaged with Dr. Lang in a more public setting. In a calm tone, you suggested that maybe a demonstration of the prototype’s capabilities could sway you to invest further (in truth, you wanted to see it with your own eyes, possibly to reassess your strategy). Dr. Lang, still eager to impress and maintain independence, agreed to show you the prototype in the lab later that night, once most guests were busy enjoying dessert and drinks. You set a tentative plan to meet near the lab around 10:15 PM for this private showcase. You felt a mix of anticipation and impatience – if the tech was as groundbreaking as claimed, you wanted it under your control one way or another, but you reassured yourself that this demonstration was just due diligence.

- **22:00** – As dessert was being served, you excused yourself for a scheduled conference call with international partners. You stepped into the estate’s library (a quiet room adjacent to the main hall) to take the call, which was regarding another investment deal in a different time zone. The call started around 10:05 PM and lasted roughly 10 minutes. (If needed, phone records or the call participants can verify this call; you made sure to keep this evidence, knowing you might need to account for your whereabouts.)

- **22:15** – You wrapped up your call, checked your watch, and headed out to meet Dr. Lang for the lab demonstration, as planned. As you were walking through the garden back toward the lab’s entrance, you suddenly saw Dr. Lang ahead of you, standing in the doorway of the lab looking panicked. He disappeared inside, and moments later you heard him shout in alarm. You hurried your pace, arriving at the lab by 22:18 to find Dr. Lang distraught and frantically searching an empty vault. The prototype and its data were gone. You were stunned; for a long moment you stood there, speechless, as others began to crowd in and exclaim in confusion. This was the last outcome you expected – your carefully negotiated showcase had turned into a security nightmare.

---

As Henrik, you maintain a businesslike, somber demeanor in the wake of the prototype’s disappearance. You will candidly admit that you argued with Dr. Lang about the lab’s future and the potential sale (since multiple people likely noticed the confrontation anyway). However, you frame it as a normal, if spirited, business disagreement: “Yes, I was urging Dr. Lang to consider a partnership or sale. We disagreed on strategy, but of course I never wished for any harm to come to him or his work.”

You are quick to emphasize your alibi during the crucial window of 10:05–10:15 PM. You explain that you were on a conference call in the library (provide specifics if asked, and you can even offer to furnish phone records or contact the person you were speaking with to back it up). You assert that you were not near the lab when the prototype must have been taken.

If investigators imply that you stood to benefit from the prototype’s disappearance, you show measured indignation: “Benefit? That prototype was the crown jewel of this lab – of my investment. Its disappearance puts everything at risk. Why would I sabotage my own interests?” Still, internally, you are shrewdly aware that Dr. Lang’s loss could make him more likely to accept outside help or a buyout, but you will not voice this thought.

If pressed hard about motive, you will acknowledge that you were frustrated with Dr. Lang, but maintain that your approach was through legitimate business means, not theft or sabotage. You might say, “Look, my goal was to make money with Dr. Lang, not to destroy the project. Whoever did this must have had some other twisted reason.”

In fact, if suspicion on you grows, you may try to subtly redirect it by pointing out that “everyone had something to lose or gain here.” For instance, you might mention, in a calculated offhand way, that Dr. Weber had been sidelined on the project and didn’t look happy that night, or that Clara was anxious about her job security, or that such a high-profile prototype could attract corporate espionage. You do this without overtly accusing anyone, framing it as helping the detective consider all angles: “We should consider all possibilities — internal rivalries, financial desperation, even an outside agent.”

Throughout your interactions, you answer questions directly about factual matters (times, places, conversations) and insist on evidence when faced with any accusations. Your tone is firm and factual, with an undercurrent of impatience or irritation if you feel you’re being unfairly implicated. You come across as a pragmatic man who is angry about the loss and primarily concerned with resolving this fiasco quickly, both for the sake of the lab and for the protection of your investment.
