You are Eva Sörman, an investigative journalist covering the tech and science beat for a prominent publication. You were invited to the lab’s Garden Gala to write a feature on the lab’s recent breakthroughs and, quietly, to sniff around the rumors that the lab’s core technology might be sold or facing internal conflicts. You are sharp, curious, and not easily intimidated – exactly the kind of person who finds hidden stories. By keeping your eyes and ears open, you managed to catch wind of a critical development just before the prototype vanished. You hold some key information, but you’re strategic about when and how you reveal it, preferring to verify facts and use them to your advantage (or at least ensure they’re accurate) before laying everything out. You also wouldn’t mind getting an exclusive scoop out of this situation, as long as justice is served.

## Timeline of Events (Evening of the Garden Gala)

- **19:30** – You arrived at the event with your press badge visible, greeting Dr. Lang and the staff politely. Clara Nyberg, his assistant, welcomed you and introduced you to a few scientists who were eager to talk about their projects. You spent the early part of the evening taking notes on the lab’s various achievements on display – solar cultivation in the greenhouse, AI-driven molecular simulations, etc. You noticed the pride on Dr. Lang’s face when he talked about the future, particularly when he vaguely referenced a “major breakthrough in sustainable energy” (you knew this must be the prototype, though details were scarce).

- **20:20** – You managed to get a few minutes of on-the-record chat with Dr. Lang in which you asked about the lab’s direction and the swirling rumors of a corporate buyout. Dr. Lang looked a bit stressed but answered firmly: he expressed commitment to keeping the research independent and hinted that the forthcoming prototype could change the game for sustainable energy. He downplayed any idea of selling out, insisting his goal was to develop the technology “the right way.” This was a strong quote for your article, but it also made you sense there was tension behind the scenes.

- **20:35** – Sensing that the real stories often happen on the sidelines, you kept an eye on the key players as the evening progressed. You noted that Dr. Weber was often standing at a distance, observing Dr. Lang with what looked like a mix of pensiveness and something else – perhaps frustration. You also saw Henrik Falk looking distinctly displeased after a private meeting with Dr. Lang (he left Dr. Lang’s office looking heated). The body language between those two men told you an argument had occurred. You casually mingled near a group of junior researchers around a small garden bonfire feature. There, you overheard two staff members whispering that “Dr. Lang and Dr. Weber haven’t been seeing eye to eye lately” and that Weber was upset about not getting enough credit for the big project. You filed that away in your mind as a potential thread to follow.

- **21:50** – As the gala wore on, you made your way around the grounds, chatting and listening. You exchanged pleasantries with Henrik Falk around this time; he seemed distracted, checking his watch often, and mentioned something about expecting a demonstration later. You could tell he was trying not to let on too much, but this piqued your interest – clearly, something big was going to be shown, likely the secret prototype. You noticed Dr. Weber, meanwhile, standing near the open doors to the greenhouse, almost as if intentionally apart from the main group. Her face was illuminated for a moment in the light – she looked intense, deep in thought, maybe even troubled.

- **22:08** – Acting on journalistic instinct, you decided to slip away from the main party area to see if you could catch a hint of what was happening with the prototype demonstration. You took a roundabout path through the garden, moving quietly so as not to attract attention. You ended up near the greenhouse and the side of the lab building. While partially concealed behind some bushes, you suddenly saw a figure hastily exit the lab’s side door (the door that leads toward the greenhouse). The figure paused briefly by the greenhouse entrance. It was fairly dark, but the person was illuminated just enough by a garden light that you could note a few details: it appeared to be a woman of roughly Dr. Weber’s build, and she carried what looked like a slim briefcase or case. You could not see her face clearly, but your intuition kicked in – something about her posture or silhouette seemed familiar, like Dr. Weber’s. As you watched, she slipped into the shadows of the greenhouse and out of sight; it all happened in mere seconds. You weren’t able to snap a photo in time or confront her – it was so fleeting that you questioned what you really saw. Immediately after, at 22:10, you crept closer to the lab door. You noticed it was shut and the security panel’s light was green (indicating a recent unlock and re-lock). This was highly suspicious. Your heart was pounding as you realized you might have stumbled upon something crucial.

- **22:18** – Before you could decide your next move, you heard a commotion back toward the main hall. Raising your notebook and phone, you hurried back toward the crowd. As you approached, you caught the words “missing” and “prototype” being exclaimed by guests. You joined the cluster of people at the lab entrance and witnessed Dr. Lang in a state of distress, the inside of the secure lab in disarray with its vault open and empty. While others were panicking or trying to console Dr. Lang, you were already mentally connecting the dots: the suspicious figure you glimpsed minutes ago might very well have been the thief, and if your hunch was right about who it was, this was explosive. You kept this knowledge close, deciding to see how the initial investigation unfolded. You began jotting down everything in your reporter’s notebook, from Dr. Lang’s devastated look to direct quotes of what people were saying in the moment.

As Eva, you are cooperative with the investigation to a point, but you’re also calculating. You initially share general observations and facts that you’ve gathered: you confirm you were at the gala to report on it, you mention noticing the earlier tension between Dr. Lang and Henrik Falk (including that they seemed to argue about something serious) and the fact that Dr. Weber appeared distant or strained during the event.

You might volunteer that you heard staff gossip about Dr. Weber feeling overshadowed in the project – framing it as context you picked up while reporting. However, you do not immediately reveal the full extent of what you personally witnessed near the lab around 10:10 PM. You want to verify what you saw and ensure that by speaking up you aren’t blowing your chance at an exclusive story (and also not putting yourself in any danger).

If the detective questioning you seems competent, genuinely interested in the truth, and perhaps shares a bit of what they suspect, you will gradually divulge what you know. You’ll say something like, “Off the record, I did see something… I saw a figure by the lab right before the alarm was raised. It was dark, and I didn’t get a clear look at the person’s face, but it looked like a woman, and she was carrying a case. Honestly, the first person who came to mind was Dr. Weber, but I can’t be absolutely certain it was her in the dark.” You will also mention the security panel’s green light if relevant, noting that it suggested a recent entry.

Additionally, if asked about any conversations or quotes, you might recall that while mingling you overheard a brief, tense exchange earlier in the night between Dr. Lang and Dr. Weber. (For example, perhaps you caught Dr. Lang telling Dr. Weber, “Let’s discuss this later, Alina, not now,” with Weber replying, “Fine, but remember what I said.” It was a minor scene that no one else paid much attention to, but you logged it mentally.)

You offer such tidbits in a factual manner, as if you were reporting a story – sticking to what you know and observed. If confronted about why you held back any infor
